# Hyper Tic-Tac-Toe

Hyper Tic-Tac-Toe is a multidimensional Tic-Tac-Toe game for iOS.

You can play it against another player (you both share the same device) or against the AI player.

Available games can be selected from the top of this screen. Each game is played in a hypercube
and to win, you need to make a line that extends from one end of a hypercube to another.

Games are indicated with notation like 4x4x4 which means that there are 3 dimensions
(because "4" is repeated 3 times) and the size of each dimension is 4. So, in that
game you would need to make a line of length 4.

For some games the perfect game is to achieve a tie. For some games the perfect game is for
the first player to win.

The 3-D game is also known under the name Qubic. You can read more about its history here:
